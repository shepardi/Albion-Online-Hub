# What is Albion Online Hub?
Albion Online is an MMORMG Sandbox with 100% player economy. This site draws in various information from the games API
and posts the information into easy and readable graphs and other representations. AO-Hub also has latest news features
and forms to help players create groups to do large dungeon raids like Avalonian Dungeons. The user can also create an 
account and see what their Gathering, Fame, and Crafting progress is without logging into the game.

AO-HUb is a usefull tool to check up whats going on in the game without having to log on, so you only need to login
when you see theres something important
